## Dream Team Documentation: Building the Azure DevOps MCP Server

### Overview

The Azure DevOps MCP server is a complex tool that requires a multidisciplinary team with expertise in software development, Azure DevOps, security, testing, documentation, project management, and AI integration. The following roles are essential to ensure the server is built efficiently, securely, and in alignment with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standards.

### Key Roles and Responsibilities

#### 1. **Full-Stack Developer (Typescript/Node.js)**

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Implement the server's core functionality using Typescript and Node.js.
  - Develop and maintain MCP tools (e.g., `list_projects`, `create_work_item`).
  - Write tests as part of the implementation process (TDD).
  - Integrate with the MCP Typescript SDK and Azure DevOps APIs.
  - Write clean, modular, and efficient code following best practices.
  - Ensure code quality through comprehensive unit and integration tests.
  - Build automated testing pipelines for continuous integration.
  - Perform integration testing across components.
- **Required Skills**:
  - Proficiency in Typescript and Node.js.
  - Strong testing skills and experience with test frameworks (e.g., Jest).
  - Experience writing testable code and following TDD practices.
  - Experience with REST APIs and asynchronous programming.
  - Familiarity with Git and version control systems.
  - Understanding of modular software design.
  - Experience with API testing and mocking tools.

#### 2. **Azure DevOps API Expert**

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Guide the team on effectively using Azure DevOps REST APIs (e.g., Git, Work Item Tracking, Build).
  - Ensure the server leverages Azure DevOps features optimally (e.g., repository operations, pipelines).
  - Assist in mapping MCP tools to the correct API endpoints.
  - Troubleshoot API-related issues and optimize API usage.
  - Help develop tests for Azure DevOps API integrations.
- **Required Skills**:
  - Deep understanding of Azure DevOps services and their REST APIs.
  - Experience with Azure DevOps workflows (e.g., repositories, work items, pipelines).
  - Knowledge of Azure DevOps authentication mechanisms (PAT, AAD).
  - Ability to interpret API documentation and handle rate limits.
  - Experience testing API integrations.

#### 3. **Security Specialist**

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Design and implement secure authentication methods (PAT and AAD).
  - Ensure credentials are stored and managed securely (e.g., environment variables).
  - Scope permissions to the minimum required for each tool.
  - Implement error handling and logging without exposing sensitive data.
  - Conduct security reviews and recommend improvements.
  - Develop security tests and validation procedures.
- **Required Skills**:
  - Expertise in API security, authentication, and authorization.
  - Familiarity with Azure Active Directory and PAT management.
  - Knowledge of secure coding practices and vulnerability prevention.
  - Experience with logging, auditing, and compliance.
  - Experience with security testing tools and methodologies.

#### 4. **Technical Writer**

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Create comprehensive documentation, including setup guides, tool descriptions, and usage examples.
  - Write clear API references and troubleshooting tips.
  - Ensure documentation is accessible to both technical and non-technical users.
  - Maintain up-to-date documentation as the server evolves.
- **Required Skills**:
  - Strong technical writing and communication skills.
  - Ability to explain complex concepts simply.
  - Experience documenting APIs and developer tools.
  - Familiarity with Markdown and documentation platforms (e.g., GitHub README).

#### 5. **Project Manager**

- **Required Skills**:
  - Experience in agile project management.
  - Proficiency with project tracking tools (e.g., Azure Boards, Jira).
  - Strong organizational and leadership skills.
  - Ability to manage remote or distributed teams.

#### 6. **AI Integration Consultant**

- **Responsibilities**:
  - Advise on how the server can best integrate with AI models (e.g., Claude Desktop).
  - Ensure tools are designed to support AI-driven workflows (e.g., user story to pull request).
  - Provide insights into MCP's AI integration capabilities.
  - Assist in testing AI interactions with the server.
- **Required Skills**:
  - Experience with AI model integration and workflows.
  - Understanding of the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
  - Familiarity with AI tools like Claude Desktop.
  - Ability to bridge AI and software development domains.
